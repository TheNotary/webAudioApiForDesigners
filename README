Deprication Notice:  Howler.JS now exists.  This repo is cool to casually look at to see the WebAudioAPI in action, but Howler.JS is more actively developed and probably tested more robustly than this project.  I happen to like its syntax too.  https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js

Checkout http://css-tricks.com/web-audio-api-sound-on-hover/ for a full writeup.  


A web Audio API to make adding sounds to your web app a no brainer, yet take full advantage of Chrome's new web audio API.  

Usage:  

1)  
Add this script to your project html code.  
    <script src="/javascripts/webAudioApiForDesigners.js"></script>

2)
Play a sound using javascript.  
    // 1
    var context = initializeNewWebAudioContext();

    // 2
    context.loadSound('audio/beep.ogg', 'beep');

    $("#nav-one a")
        .mouseenter(function() {
        // 3
        context.playSound('beep');
    });
